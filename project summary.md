## Conclusion
Model comparison, best models

Significant predictors, minimal number of tests

209 methods

## Future Work

Currently, we are concerned about the accuracy of predicting `AD` patients particularly, so the best model on predicting only `AD` probably does not have a high accuracy on other classes. In the future, we will extend our goal to achieve high accuracy of predicting `CN` and `CI` by spending more time tuning parameters for existing models or trying new models. 

To further extend this project, we might take one step further and investigate whether certain AD testing method is more
accurate for a certain group of patient (e.g. White male older than 75) in diagnosing AD. To do that, we will
conduct statistically testings between groups of patients with shared characteristics on the performance of
different testing methods. If some patterns are found, doctors can be far more efficient in diagnosing patients from various backgrounds.
